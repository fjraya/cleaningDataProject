# cleaningDataProject

In R Studio: 

1. Set your workspace.
2. Download and unzip the dataset into your workspace. 
3. Write source("run_analysis.R") in console. 
4. Once run finish, a new file called "final_tidy_dataset.txt" appears in your workspace.

This script assumes that you have installed all mandatory dependencies (dplyr, ...)
